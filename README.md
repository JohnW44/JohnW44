## Hi there 👋, Thanks for visiting!

## 💬 About me
 * Full-stack software developer based out of San Diego, CA
 * I mostly code in Javascript and Python
 * I enjoy golfing, hiking, exploring new cities, trying new food, live music, sports, retro and indie video games
 * I was a residential electrician and production manager at a small tool and die shop in my past life
 * the birth of my son (now 2 years old) put a hitaus on most of the activities above
 * but he gave me the opportunity to start my real passion of creating apps and coding!

## 💥 My goals
 * Learning TypeScript and Sass
 * Expanding my knowledge in the AI field and how to effectively implement it into apps
 * Continue improving on my capstone project "No Worries" (Feel free to play around on it and let me know if you have suggestions)
 * Landing a job!!

## ⚡Fun facts
 * I'm originally from Chicago and I'm loyal to the terrible football and basketball teams to a fault (MJ > Lebron)
 * Big Padres fans since moving cities, I go to multiple games per year
 * My super power is that I have nearly infinite patience
